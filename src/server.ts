/**
 * The HTTP surface.
 *
 * Rule 4 of docs/ecosystem/03 §2: `/livez`, `/readyz` and `/metrics` on every service, or it does
 * not pass CI.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * **THE PATHS ARE `/v1/…`, AND THE RESOURCE NAMES DO NOT COLLIDE WITH ANOTHER SERVICE'S.**
 *
 * `deploy/gateway/dynamic/public-api.yml` mounts `api.<apex>/v1/<resource>` uniformly and routes by
 * RESOURCE rather than by service, which works only because no method+path pair collides across
 * the estate. Serving `/v1` natively puts this service in the forwarded-unchanged half, which is
 * the half to be in: a strip rule is a second place the public path is decided, and it drifts.
 *
 * `communities`, `proposals` and `delegations` are this service's. Note what is NOT used:
 * `/v1/votes` is deliberately absent as a top-level resource — a vote has no identity outside its
 * proposal and `POST /v1/proposals/:id/votes` says so.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * **AUTHORITY IS A MEMBERSHIP ROW, READ FROM THE DATABASE, NEVER FROM THE REQUEST.**
 *
 * Every route that acts within a community resolves the caller's role with `roleIn`, which returns
 * null for anything that is not an `active` membership. There is no header, body field or query
 * parameter anywhere in this file that names a role, and a community id is only ever taken from
 * the path or from the row being acted on.
 *
 * **A 404 rather than a 403 for a community the caller cannot see.** A 403 confirms the id exists,
 * which makes private communities enumerable.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * **THE EXECUTE ROUTE IS `/internal`, AND ITS SCOPE MATCH IS EXACT.**
 *
 * `POST /internal/proposals/:id/execute` is the manual counterpart of the execute job — the thing
 * an operator runs when the job has dead-lettered. It requires a SERVICE token carrying
 * `community:execute` matched with `includes`, not `hasScope`: `runtime/packages/auth`'s matcher
 * honours one wildcard level, so a token carrying `community:*` would be admitted, and this route
 * spends a treasury. See `scopes.ts` for the estate's two matchers and why neither was changed.
 *
 * It cannot bypass the timelock. Nothing can — the timelock is a BEFORE INSERT trigger on
 * `executions`, and this route reaches it through exactly the same `executeProposal` the job does.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * **`POST /v1/events` IS SIGNATURE-CHECKED OVER THE RAW BYTES, BEFORE IT IS PARSED.**
 *
 * It consumes `identity.user.deleted`, which pseudonymises a member's governance record. Unsigned,
 * it is an erase-anybody's-membership endpoint reachable by anything that can open a socket to the
 * app network.

/**
 * The `identity.user.deleted` handler.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * **ERASURE HERE IS PSEUDONYMISATION, AND THAT IS A DECISION RATHER THAN A SHORTCUT.**
 *
 * A recorded vote is part of a governance record that other people relied on when they decided how
 * to vote, and — for a `treasury_spend` — that a ledger entry was posted against. Deleting the vote
 * rows would silently change a historical tally and could retroactively un-pass a proposal whose
 * money has already moved, leaving an execution with no mandate behind it and no way to reconstruct
 * one.
 *
 * So vote rows keep their weight and their choice while the subject becomes an opaque token derived
 * from nothing. The arithmetic is unchanged; the person is no longer identifiable from it.
 *
 * **THE TOMBSTONE IS IRREVERSIBLE, AND THAT IS THE PROPERTY THE WHOLE DESIGN RESTS ON.**
 * `user:erased-<uuid>` is `crypto.randomUUID()` — CSPRNG output, generated per erasure, written to
 * the row and never stored anywhere alongside the subject it replaced. There is no mapping table,
 * no reverse index and nothing to compromise: this is destruction of the link, not a lookup that
 * somebody with enough access could run backwards. It is deliberately NOT a hash of the user id,
 * because a hash of a known-format identifier is reversible by anybody who can enumerate user ids —
 * and a uuid namespace is entirely enumerable given the pepper-free construction a hash would have.
 * One fresh token per erasure, not one per row, so a person's rows still join to each other; that
 * is what keeps a historical tally reconstructible without naming anyone.
 *
 * ── PER-TABLE DECISION ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

 * |---------------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
 * | memberships               | delete     | The live authority record. It grants a capability   |
 * |                           |            | and there is no reason to keep one for an account   |
 * |                           |            | that no longer exists. Deleted outright.            |
 * | votes.subject             | anonymise  | The tally must survive; the voter need not. See     |
 * | votes.cast_by             |            | above, and `community_refuse_vote_update` in        |
 * |                           |            | migrations, which permits exactly these two columns |
 * |                           |            | to be rewritten and refuses choice/weight/proposal. |
 * | proposals.author          | anonymise  | A proposal's text is the community's record; who    |
 * |                           |            | tabled it is not needed to read it.                 |
 * | proposals.target_subject  | anonymise  | A `role_change` proposal names the member it is     |
 * |                           |            | about. That is the erased person, in a column no    |
 * |                           |            | shape CHECK covers, and it was being left behind.   |
 * | discussion_posts.author   | anonymise  | Same as proposals.author.                           |
 * | discussion_posts.body     | anonymise  | **The body was being kept.** `redacted_at` only     |
 * |                           |            | masks it on READ (`proposals.ts`); the text the |
 * |                           |            | person wrote — which is free-form and routinely     |
 * |                           |            | contains their own personal data — stayed in the    |
 * |                           |            | table. Redaction-on-read is a display rule, not     |
 * |                           |            | erasure. The body is now overwritten.               |
 * | delegations.*_subject     | anonymise  | **Both subject columns were being kept.** The       |
 * |                           |            | handler set `revoked_at` and nothing else, so every |
 * |                           |            | delegation the person made or received still named  |
 * |                           |            | them in the clear. Revoking an edge is not erasing  |
 * |                           |            | the person on it.                                   |
 * | communities.owner_subject | anonymise  | **Was being kept.** A community founder's           |
 * |                           |            | `user:<uuid>` survived erasure entirely. The        |
 * |                           |            | community itself is other members' and stays.       |
 * | executions.executed_by    | anonymise  | **Was being kept.** What the row exists to prove is |
 * |                           |            | "this proposal executed exactly once, and here is   |
 * |                           |            | the ledger entry" — the uniqueness constraint, the  |
 * |                           |            | idempotency key and `ledger_entry_id` all survive   |
 * |                           |            | untouched. None of that needs the person, and the   |
 * |                           |            | durable accountability record is admin-api's        |
 * |                           |            | hash-chained audit, not this column.                |
 * | proposals.spend_recipient | RETAIN     | A community voted to pay this person and a ledger   |
 * |                           |            | entry was posted against it. Art. 17(3)(b) — the    |
