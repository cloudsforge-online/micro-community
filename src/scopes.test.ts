/**
 * The scope matcher, and the decision behind it.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * **THE TEST THIS FILE EXISTS FOR IS `community:* GRANTS NOTHING HERE`.**
 *
 * 18-build-status.md §3.3h records that the estate ships two scope matchers which disagree:
 * `contracts/packages/auth/src/index.ts:209` is exact, `runtime/packages/auth/src/index.ts:178`
 * honours one wildcard level. Both are CI-green and neither is wrong on its own terms, and §3.3h
 * leaves both as they are deliberately — an authorisation matcher is the highest-blast-radius edit
 * in this estate. **Neither package is changed by this repository.**
 *
 * This repository chose the EXACT one, matching `micro-devplatform` and `micro-admin-api`, and the
 * reason is what this service does rather than a taste for strictness: a passed proposal spends
 * money, and `POST /internal/proposals/:id/execute` is the machine surface of a treasury. A token
 * carrying `community:*` — which is what a broadly-scoped integration token looks like, and what a
 * compromised one looks like — must not be the credential that executes a spend.
 *
 * The test asserts BOTH sides: `grantsScope` refuses the wildcard, AND `hasScope` from the shipped
 * runtime package accepts it. The second half is what makes the first mean something — without it,
 * this is a test that a function does what it says rather than a test that a real divergence was
 * navigated deliberately.
