/**
 * Scopes, and the estate's two scope matchers.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * **THIS REPOSITORY USES THE EXACT MATCHER. `community:*` GRANTS NOTHING HERE.**
 *
 * 18-build-status.md §3.3h records a divergence that is a decision rather than a defect:
 *
 *   | Package                    | Line               | Semantics                                |
 *   | `contracts/packages/auth`  | `src/index.ts` | `granted.includes(required)` — exact only |
 *   | `runtime/packages/auth`    | `src/index.ts` | honours one wildcard level: `foo:*` → `foo:bar` |
 *
 * Both are shipped, both are CI-green, and §3.3h leaves both as they are deliberately — changing
 * an authorisation matcher is the highest-blast-radius edit available in this estate. **Neither
 * package is changed by this repository.**
 *
 * The choice made here is the **exact** one, matching `micro-devplatform` and `micro-admin-api`,
 * and the reason is specific to what this service does rather than a preference for strictness:
 *
 *   **A passed proposal spends money.** `POST /internal/proposals/:id/execute` and the internal
 *   routes beside it are the machine surface of a treasury. A service token carrying
 *   `community:*` — which is what a broadly-scoped integration token looks like, and what a
 *   compromised one looks like — must not be the credential that executes a spend. The estate has
 *   not decided what a wildcard means; a service that moves money is not the place for it to find
 *   out.
 *
 * So this file's `grantsScope` is `granted.includes(required)`, `hasScope` from
 * `@cloudsforge/auth` is deliberately NOT used on any route that writes, and `scopes.test.ts`
 * proves `community:*` is refused — in both directions, so that the day somebody swaps the
 * matcher the test fails rather than the treasury opening.
